# Research
  1. require.main === module
  2. Make file on 111 (running tests with makefile)
  3. Why `mocha tests` passes, but `./node_modules/.bin/mocha tests` fails
  4. Where does seed data go, when running `sh seed.sh` (running seed data script)
  5. What is express.static (used in middleware and routing configuration)
  6. Why does middleware function use `next` function (stalls without it)
